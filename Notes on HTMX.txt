Hypermedia Model of the Web:
1. TODO: Define this.

HTXM Core: 
1. Allow any element in a web page to issue HTTP requests.
2. Expect the response to that request to be HTML (possibly partial bits of HTML)

3. Uses "transclusion" to replace parts of the DOM.


AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript + XML

HTMX Opportunities:

1. Hypermedia Control
Allow any element to be a hypermedia control, not just <a href> and buttons inside forms. 

Any element can issue HTTP requests to the server.

2. HTML could be extended to allow ANY event, not just a click, to trigger HTTP requests.

3. HTML could be extended to allow access to the three missing HTTP methods: PUT, DELETE, PATCH.

Currently HTML only supports GET and POST.

GET: Read only. Get a resource.
POST: Submit data. Creating or mutating resources.
PUT: Submits an entity for update or replacement.
PATCH: Like PUT, but implies partial update rather than complete replacement.
DELETE: Deletes a resource

These operations make up CRUD.

4. HTML could be extended to allow responses to requests to replace elements within the current document, instead of replacing the entire document.

Anchors cause a "flash" of un-styled content and it redraws the whole screen.

HTMX allows the application to function more like a Single Page Application by only updated part of the DOM at a time.


TidBits:
1. No JS required besides the HTMX library. You just use HTMX attributes on elements in your HTML.

Notes:
1. When you load from unpkg you should get an integrity hash from https://srihash.org.
